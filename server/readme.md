# Example server

A small implementation of the API that the key cabinet expects.

There's probably something missing and not working, written as an
example of a previously present API that was used with an implementation
of the cabinet.

This version does not use HTTPS or any database, which is what you would like for an application of this cabinet.

start the server and go to http://localhost:5000/api/ui/#/Keylogs.
