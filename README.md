# Introduction

This project is supposed to result in a key-cabinet which can be remotely logged
and booked. This might be useful for smaller organizations with some amount of
keys, that wishes to log which person has taken which key.

The idea of the project is only to log which key has been taken, there has been
no consideration for the security of those keys.

DON'T USE THIS AS SECURITY FOR YOUR KEYS!
